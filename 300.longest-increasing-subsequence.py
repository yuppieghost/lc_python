# Testcase Example:  '[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]'
#
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing
# subsequence.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the
# length is 4.
#
# Note:
#
#
# There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to
# return the length.
# Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) complexity.
#
#
# Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        n = len(nums)
        res = [1] * n
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    res[i] = max(res[i], 1 + res[j])
        return max(res)
